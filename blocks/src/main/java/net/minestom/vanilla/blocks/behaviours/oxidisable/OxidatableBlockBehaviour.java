/**
 * Oxidation (<a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Copper#Waxing">Source</a>)
 * <p>
 *     Non-waxed copper blocks have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and
 *     axes can remove the oxidation on copper blocks. As the block begins to oxidize (exposed copper), it gets
 *     discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper), the block is a green
 *     color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.
 *     Oxidation of copper blocks relies only on random ticks. Rain or water does not accelerate oxidation, and covering
 *     copper blocks with other blocks does not prevent oxidation. In Java Edition, groups of non-waxed copper blocks
 *     oxidize far more slowly than single copper blocks that are spaced at least 4 blocks apart. This is because a
 *     block in a group being less oxidized than the others slows down the oxidation process for all other blocks within
 *     4 blocks of taxicab distance. However, if one wishes to increase the oxidation speed, placing oxidized copper
 *     blocks around less oxidized copper blocks does not offer a speed improvement over simply placing the blocks 4
 *     apart. The calculations for the oxidation behavior are as follows:
 *     In Java Edition, when a random tick is given, a copper block has a 64/1125 chance to enter a state called
 *     pre-oxidation. This means a copper block enters pre-oxidation after approximately 20 minutes.
 *     In pre-oxidation, the copper block searches its nearby non-waxed copper blocks for a distance of 4 blocks taxicab
 *     distance. If there is any copper block that has a lower oxidation level, then the pre-oxidation ends, meaning
 *     that this copper block does not weather. Let a be the number of all nearby non-waxed copper blocks, and b be the
 *     number of nearby non-waxed copper blocks that have a higher oxidation level. We derive the value of c from this
 *     equation: c = b + 1/a + 1. We also let the modifying factor m be 0.75 if the copper block has no oxidation level,
 *     or 1 if the copper block is exposed or weathered.[1] Then the oxidation probability is mc2. For example, an
 *     unweathered copper block surrounded by 6 unweathered copper blocks and 6 exposed copper blocks has a 21.7% chance
 *     to oxidize if it enters the pre-oxidation state. In this case, a = 12, b = 6, and m = 0.75.[2] The most efficient
 *     way of laying out the copper blocks for oxidation is in a 7×7×6 face-centered cubic (fcc)/cubic close-packed
 *     (ccp) lattice.
